# Alecto web

Marketing site for Alecto Conveyancing (Voorstel 2: "Live").
Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev). No framework.

Design: Figma file "Alecto-web", page **Voorstel 2 — Live** (light and dark frames).

## Run it

Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as package manager and runtime (Vite runs on Bun via `bunx --bun`).

```bash
bun install
bun run dev       # local dev server with hot reload
bun run build     # static build into dist/
bun run preview   # serve the build locally
```

`dist/` is a static site and can go to any host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, S3).

## Structure

```
index.html              all page markup
public/favicon.svg
src/styles/tokens.css   brand colour tokens, light + dark (mirrors the Figma variables "Alecto / Brand")
src/styles/main.css     layout, components and sections
src/js/main.js          entry: wires everything up
src/js/loader.js        intro: blocks fall into a square, collapse into the dot, dot lands in the headline
src/js/hero.js          live hero: tile skyline per stage, live activity toasts, cursor lift
src/js/decor.js         stage stacks (How it works) and the CTA skyline
src/js/theme.js         light / dark toggle
src/js/palette.js       brand gradient + small helpers
```

## Design rules

- **Square, always.** Every corner is 0, matching the logo dot. Only avatars (people) are round.
- **The dot is the signature.** Section headings end in the accent square instead of a full stop.
- **Colour comes from tokens.** Change values in `tokens.css`, never in components. The tile gradient lives in `palette.js` (`STOPS`).
- **Dark mode** follows the OS setting by default. The toggle saves the choice in `localStorage` (`alecto-theme`).

## Intro loader

The loader plays once per browser session (`sessionStorage` key `alecto-intro-seen`).
Add `?intro` to the URL to force it, for example `http://localhost:5173/?intro`.
With reduced motion enabled the loader and build-up are skipped and the finished skyline is shown.

## Placeholder content to replace before launch

- Live activity in the hero (`EVENTS`, `CITIES`, the counters) is illustrative. To make it real, feed it anonymised case events from Alecto's case system.
- Dashboard mockup data (Hannah Reid, 14 Elm Road, dates) is invented.
- Reviews are paraphrased themes from real reviews, not the original wording.
- "5 wks", "replies within 2 hours" and "fixed quote in two minutes" need confirming with Alecto.
- Four FAQ answers say "Answer to be supplied by Alecto".
- Most links point to `#` until the routes exist.
